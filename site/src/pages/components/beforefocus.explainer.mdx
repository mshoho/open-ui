## Introduction

Browsers include complex heuristics for determining the next element to focus, but these aren't
exposed to web developers, leaving them to implement these heuristics from scratch, often requiring
DOM modifications, or writing code that causes reflows and style recomputations. It can be hard or
sometimes impossible to apply in some particular scenarios (for example, you might have control of
a parent list component, but not the contents of the list items).

While having additional new high level abstractions to handle keyboard navigation (such as the
[focusgroup](./focusgroup.explainer)) will be useful, there is a multitude of different
scenarios for focus management, and lower level primitives will give web developers more flexibility.

This proposal focuses on having two fairly simple lower level primitives which would arguably allow
the developers to implement whatever patterns they prefer without working around the browser
limitations and impossibilities.

Namely, one method called `document.advanceFocus()` and one event called `beforefocus`.

> **Status:** I have a full-featured implementation for Chromium, it is reasonably simple and
> straightforward, because everything needed is already present in the browser internally. I work on
> submitting it to Chromium Gerrit as a prototype behind the `FocusNavigation` feature flag.

## Opting In

Both `document.advanceFocus()` and the `beforefocus` event require explicit opt-in via a meta tag. 
This design choice ensures backward compatibility and gives developers control over when to enable
these new behaviors:

```html
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="advanceFocus beforefocus">
```

You can enable one or both features independently:

```html
<!-- Enable only advanceFocus -->
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="advanceFocus">

<!-- Enable only beforefocus -->
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="beforefocus">

<!-- Enable both (recommended for most use cases) -->
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="advanceFocus beforefocus">
```

The meta tag values are case-insensitive, so `"AdvanceFocus BeforeFocus"` works the same way.

Without the meta tag:
- `document.advanceFocus()` exists but returns `false` and has no effect
- The `beforefocus` event does not fire

## document.advanceFocus()

`document.advanceFocus()` exposes the default action the browsers have for `Tab` and
`Shift+Tab` presses for programmatic usage.

### Signature

```ts
document.advanceFocus(options?: AdvanceFocusOptions): boolean

interface AdvanceFocusOptions {
  startElement?: Element;        // Starting point for navigation (default: document.activeElement)
  stayWithinElement?: Element;   // Constrains navigation to stay within this container
  backward?: boolean;            // Navigate backward like Shift+Tab (default: false)
  wrap?: boolean;                // Wrap around when reaching boundaries (default: true)
  includeStartElement?: boolean; // Include startElement as a candidate (default: false)
}
```

### Return Value

- Returns `true` if focus was successfully moved to an element
- Returns `false` if:
  - No focusable element was found
  - The `beforefocus` event was cancelled
  - The feature is not enabled via meta tag

### Options Explained

#### `startElement`

The starting point from which the browser should start looking for the next element to focus.

```js
// Start navigation from a specific element
document.advanceFocus({ startElement: myButton });
```

If not specified, defaults to `document.activeElement`.

#### `backward`

The direction of navigation. When `false` (default), behaves like `Tab`. When `true`, behaves
like `Shift+Tab`.

```js
// Navigate forward (like Tab)
document.advanceFocus();
document.advanceFocus({ backward: false });

// Navigate backward (like Shift+Tab)
document.advanceFocus({ backward: true });
```

#### `stayWithinElement`

Constrains the focus navigation to stay within a specified container element. Focus will not
move outside of this element.

```js
// Only navigate within a specific container
const dialog = document.getElementById('my-dialog');
document.advanceFocus({ stayWithinElement: dialog });
```

This is useful for implementing focus traps in modal dialogs, custom dropdown menus, circular
arrow-keys navigable lists and similar UI patterns.

#### `wrap`

Controls whether focus wraps around when reaching the boundaries.

When `stayWithinElement` is specified:
- `wrap: true` (default): Focus wraps from last element back to first (or vice versa for backward)
- `wrap: false`: Focus stops at the boundary and `advanceFocus()` returns `false`

When `stayWithinElement` is not specified:
- `wrap: true` (default): Focus wraps from the end of the page to the beginning
- `wrap: false`: Focus can move to the browser's address bar (normal Tab behavior)

```js
// Stop at boundaries instead of wrapping
const result = document.advanceFocus({
  stayWithinElement: container,
  wrap: false
});

if (!result) {
  // Reached the boundary - handle accordingly
}
```

#### `includeStartElement`

When `true`, the `startElement` itself is considered as a candidate for focus if it is focusable.
This is useful when you want to to skip some part of the application and continue from a specific
place. For example, you have a tree and want to skip the subtree and move to the next tree item on
the same level when the down arrow is pressed.

```js
// Focus the startElement if it's focusable
document.advanceFocus({
  startElement: myElement,
  includeStartElement: true
});
```

### Expected Behaviors

- If an `<iframe>` comes after the starting element, `advanceFocus()` moves focus to the first
  focusable element inside the iframe (if any), or past the iframe — the same behavior as `Tab`.
- The same logic applies for backward navigation with `Shift+Tab`.
- `advanceFocus()` only has effect when the document is focused. It also requires user
activation (it doesn't have an effect when called in some setTimeout callback without an actual
user interaction with the page). If focus is in the browser's address bar or another frame, it
returns `false`.

## beforefocus Event

The `beforefocus` event is dispatched *before* the browser wants to focus an element. Calling
`preventDefault()` on the event prevents the element from receiving focus.

### Event Properties

```ts
interface BeforefocusEvent extends UIEvent {
  target: Element;        // The element about to receive focus
  detail: FocusType;      // Numeric code indicating the reason for focus
  bubbles: true;
  cancelable: true;
  composed: true;         // Crosses shadow DOM boundaries
}

enum FocusType {
  kScript = 1,    // element.focus() was called
  kForward = 2,   // Tab key or advanceFocus() forward
  kBackward = 3   // Shift+Tab or advanceFocus({ backward: true })
}
```

### The `detail` Property

The `detail` property indicates why the element is about to receive focus. The values correspond
to the internal `FocusType` enum in the current Chromium implementation:

> **Note:** These numeric values are currently taken directly from Chromium's internal `FocusType`
> enum. The final standardized API may use different values, string constants, or a dedicated
> property instead of `detail`. We most likely don't want to directly expose `0` when the focus is
> moved by an assistive technology (like a screen reader). For the screen reader focus movements
> we most likely want to send Forward/Backward value (depending on the relative position of a new
> element comparing to the current one).

| Value | Name | Triggered By |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `0` | None | Catch-all (includes autofocus and accessibility-based focusing) |
| `1` | Script | `element.focus()` |
| `2` | Forward | `Tab` key, `advanceFocus()` |
| `3` | Backward | `Shift+Tab`, `advanceFocus({ backward: true })` |
| `4` | SpatialNavigation | Spatial navigation (TV/game controller interfaces) |
| `5` | Mouse | Mouse click on a focusable element |
| `6` | AccessKey | Access key activation (e.g., `Alt+Key` on Windows) |

```js
element.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  switch (event.detail) {
    case 0: // None: autofocus, assistive technology
      console.log('Focus via autofocus or other means');
      break;
    case 1: // Script
      console.log('Focus via element.focus()');
      break;
    case 2: // Forward
      console.log('Tab pressed or advanceFocus() called');
      break;
    case 3: // Backward
      console.log('Shift+Tab pressed');
      break;
    case 5: // Mouse
      console.log('User clicked the element');
      break;
    // ... etc
  }
});
```

### Event Timing

The `beforefocus` event fires *before* the `blur` and `focus` events in the focus sequence:

1. `beforefocus` (on the target element, cancelable)
2. `blur` (on the previously focused element)
3. `focus` (on the new element)

If `beforefocus` is cancelled, neither `blur` nor `focus` events fire, and focus remains unchanged.

### Important Behaviors

- **Cancellation prevents focus**: Calling `event.preventDefault()` stops the element from
  receiving focus. This is the core functionality that enables focus redirection and prevention.
- **Bubbles through the DOM**: The event bubbles, allowing parent elements to intercept and
  potentially cancel focus changes for their children.
- **Composed**: The event crosses shadow DOM boundaries, enabling web components to participate
  in focus management.

## Behavior with Iframes

Both features work across iframe boundaries with specific behaviors designed for security
and flexibility:

### beforefocus and Iframes

When focus is about to move into an iframe:

1. **Parent frame first**: The `beforefocus` event fires on the `<iframe>` element in the
   parent document first
2. **Cancellation at parent**: If the parent cancels the event, focus does not enter the iframe
3. **Child frame next**: If not cancelled, `beforefocus` fires on the actual target element
   inside the iframe (if the iframe has opted in)

This allows parent applications to control whether child iframes can receive focus (when, for
example, an embedded third party iframe uncontollably wants to steal focus):

```js
// Parent document
iframe.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  if (shouldPreventIframeFocus()) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
```

### Per-Frame Opt-In

Each frame must independently opt in via its own meta tag:

```html
<!-- Parent document -->
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="advanceFocus beforefocus">
<iframe src="child.html"></iframe>
```

```html
<!-- child.html -->
<meta name="focus-navigation" content="advanceFocus beforefocus">
```

- If parent has the meta tag but child doesn't: Parent receives `beforefocus` on the iframe
  element, but child never fires `beforefocus` on its elements
- If child has the meta tag but parent doesn't: Parent doesn't receive `beforefocus`, but
  child elements fire `beforefocus` normally

### advanceFocus and Iframes

- `advanceFocus()` naturally navigates into and out of iframes, following the same tab order
  as the `Tab` key
- When called from a frame that doesn't have focus, it returns `false`
- Each frame's `advanceFocus()` operates within the context of that frame unless navigation
  naturally crosses frame boundaries

## Usage Examples

### Focus Trap for Modal Dialogs

Implement a focus trap without sentinel elements:

```js
const dialog = document.getElementById('modal-dialog');

dialog.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  // If focus is trying to leave the dialog, prevent it
  if (!dialog.contains(event.target)) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});

// Navigate within the dialog only
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Tab' && dialogIsOpen) {
    e.preventDefault();
    document.advanceFocus({
      stayWithinElement: dialog,
      backward: e.shiftKey,
      wrap: true
    });
  }
});
```

### List Navigation with Selected Item

Common pattern: Tab into a list should focus the selected item, not the first item.

```html
<ul id="listbox" role="listbox">
  <li tabindex="0">Item 1</li>
  <li tabindex="0" aria-selected="true">Item 2 (selected)</li>
  <li tabindex="0">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

```js
const list = document.getElementById('listbox');

list.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  const selectedItem = list.querySelector('[aria-selected="true"]');

  // When tabbing into the list from outside
  if ((event.detail === 2 || event.detail === 3) &&  // Forward or backward navigation
      !list.contains(document.activeElement) &&       // Coming from outside the list
      selectedItem &&
      !selectedItem.contains(event.target)) {         // Not already targeting selected item

    event.preventDefault();
    selectedItem.focus();
  }
});
```

### Preventing Unwanted Focus Theft

Prevent background content from stealing focus (e.g., lazy-loaded iframes):

```js
const activePanel = document.querySelector('.active-panel');

document.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  // Only allow focus within the active panel
  if (!activePanel.contains(event.target)) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
```

### Focus Redirection

Redirect focus to a different element:

```js
const deprecatedButton = document.getElementById('old-button');
const newButton = document.getElementById('new-button');

deprecatedButton.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  newButton.focus();
});
```

### Skip Navigation Links

Implement skip links that work with Tab navigation:

```js
const skipLink = document.getElementById('skip-to-main');
const mainContent = document.getElementById('main');

skipLink.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  if (event.detail === 2) { // Forward navigation only
    event.preventDefault();

    document.advanceFocus({
      startElement: mainContent,
      includeStartElement: true
    });
  }
});
```

### Custom Focusgroup-like Navigation

Skip non-entry items in a focusgroup pattern:

```js
const toolbar = document.getElementById('toolbar');
const items = toolbar.querySelectorAll('.toolbar-item');
const entryItem = items[0]; // First item is the entry point

toolbar.addEventListener('beforefocus', (event) => {
  // If navigating to a toolbar item that isn't the entry point
  if ((event.detail === 2 || event.detail === 3) &&
      event.target.classList.contains('toolbar-item') &&
      event.target !== entryItem) {

    event.preventDefault();

    // Focus the entry item instead
    entryItem.focus();
  }
});
```

## Summary

The combination of `document.advanceFocus()` and the `beforefocus` event provides low-level
primitives for implementing various high-level keyboard navigation patterns. These primitives
enable developers to implement:
- Modal dialogs with focus traps
- List navigations
- Focus theft prevention
- Skip navigation
- Custom focusgroup patterns
- And much more...

All without relying on DOM mutations, roving tabindex, or invisible sentinel elements.
